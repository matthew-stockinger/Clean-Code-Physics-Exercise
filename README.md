# Clean-Code-Physics-Exercise

This is a short exercise I did while reading Robert Martin's _Clean Code_.  I was teaching a coding class at the time, and one of my students had created a small program that he was excited about.  In classic new-learner style, he had created some truly monstrous functions, so I took this as an opportunity to apply some of the things I was learning from Martin.  This is my first attempt at cleaning up someone else's code, according to the principals in that book.
